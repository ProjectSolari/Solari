### The Universe on Your Computer

```diff
- Keep in mind that Solari is still early in its development. Many features are not implemented yet.
```

 # What is Solari?
Solari is a 3D space simulator. Several features are present in the application, such as navigating and viewing planets and moons in our solar system.

In the future, we intend to expand it to other areas of the universe beyond our system. And also track the celestials in real time, with their current locations in space. (Solari still doesn't track objects in real time, you can use https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/ for that. **Not our website*)
